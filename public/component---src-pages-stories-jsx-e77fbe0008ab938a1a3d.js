During my initial visit, I mentioned that I had moved to Miami because I loved music and hoped to pursue my dream of being musician. After arriving in South Florida, I decided to return to school, and enrolled in Miami Dade College to earn an associate’s degree with a concentration in music. Unfortunately, my living situation was unstable. I soon found myself homeless and was forced to drop out of school. After living in a homeless shelter for a month and a half, I was able to secure employment and a room for rent, which allowed me to pay off my debts. Catalyst Miami Prosperity Wealth team first provided me with Free Tax Preparation services. From there, I committed to a budgeting session with a Catalyst Miami financial coach. My primary financial goal was to get caught up with my debts, which included owing money for my rent, car, car insurance and credit card. I also wanted to establish an emergency savings fund. Catalyst Miami’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance preparation program was able to secure a tax refund of $1,146 for me, including an Earned Income Tax Credit of $299. Of course, this was great news. With my refund, I was able to catch up on some of the outstanding balances that stood between my goals and me. I continue to work with the financial coaching team at Catalyst Miami to improve my financial life. I’m now current on my rent, car payment, and auto insurance. My financial coach also helped me with my resume. I attained a second job, returned to school, and received my degree. I plan to use Catalyst Miami’s Ways 2 Wealth savings program to continue building my emergency savings, allocate savings towards my musical career, and enjoy life by traveling. My next step is to attain a job in the Miami area in music while pursuing a record deal."),r.a.createElement("h3",null," Partners for financial security: "),r.a.createElement("ul",null,r.a.createElement("li",null," Coalition on Human Needs "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Collaborative Development Corporation "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Collective Empowerment Group "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Community Health Worker Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Faith in Florida "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Family Values at Work "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Florida Prosperity Partnership "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Florida Rights Restoration Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Haitian American CDC "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Half in 10 Campaign "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Injury Free Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," KidCare Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Miami Dade County PTA/PTSA "),r.a.createElement("li",null," North East 2nd Avenue Partnership (NE2P) "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Overtown Youth and Family Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," RAISE Florida "),r.a.createElement("li",null," South Florida Community Development Coalition "),r.a.createElement("li",null," Southern Christian Leadership Conference "),r.a.createElement("li",null," War on Poverty FL "),r.a.createElement("li",null," We Care of South Dade, Inc.
